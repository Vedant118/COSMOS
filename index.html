            <p>The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. <br>Common name comes from William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1842 using a 36-inch (91 cm) telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab.</p>

            <p>Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, <br>the Milky Way. We know from NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.</p>

                    <p>This planet is much larger than Jupiter or Saturn, and its ring system is roughly 200 times larger than Saturn’s rings are today. You could think of it as kind of a super Saturn.J1407b is widely known for the massive size of its rings, which are approximately 640 times the extent of the rings found on Saturn. The planet itself is regarded as the first possible exoplanet, or brown dwarf with a ring system.</p>

However, until the 2010 observations and recalculations, this planet had been thought to take about 2.8 days to orbit the star.<br>In October 2012, it was announced that 55 Cancri e could be a carbon planet.In February 2016, it was announced that NASA's Hubble Space Telescope had detected hydrogen and helium (and suggestions of hydrogen cyanide), but no water vapor, in the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e, the first time the atmosphere of a super-Earth exoplanet was analyzed successfully.</p>

Consequently, HD 149026b might be the blackest known planet in the universe, in addition to the hottest.</p>

Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years.The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.

    <h1>BLACKHOLES IN UNIVERSE</h1>
    <p>
        A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.

    <h1>ASTRONOMERS SAYS ABOUT STARS</h1>
    <p>A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light.</p>

                    Once we realized you could learn about stars from gathering their spectra, people started getting spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars in the nighttime sky.Stars are giant, luminous spheres of plasma. There are billions of them — including our own sun — in the Milky Way galaxy.

                    When stars run out of hydrogen — the fuel that sustains the nuclear fusion reactors at their cores — they become unstable and collapse in on themselves. But not all stars collapse in the same way. Some of the most massive ones explode into a supernova and then collapse down into neutron stars, or black holes.
